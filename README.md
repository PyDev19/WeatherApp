# Weather App

## Intro

This is an app called Weather App is an app that you can use to see the weather of different cities in detail. This app was made using Python and Inno Setup. This app is made by Atharva Mishra or YamiAtem on GitHub.

## How to use it

To use this app all you need to do is first have it installed after that run the app. Then you need to either enter a city name or zip code in the entry box, then press the 'Get Weather' button next to the entry box. If you entered the city/zip code correctly then it should show the following details: 

1. City Name
2. Country name of the city
3. Weather condition of the city
4. Temperature of the city
5. Min/Max temperature of city
6. Feels like temperature of city
7. Humidity of city
8. Air pressure of city
9. Wind Speed/Degree of city
10. Visibility of city

If these properties don't show up that means that you entered the wrong city name/zip code.
